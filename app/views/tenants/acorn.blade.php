      <p>Acorn is the sister restaurant to Boulder’s OAK at Fourteenth. The rustic yet refined eatery serves chef Steven Redzikowski’s eclectic New American cooking in an approachable format at The Source. Much like OAK, at the core of Acorn’s dishes is the oak-fired oven and grill. Complimenting a seasonal menu created with a commitment to locally-sourced ingredients is Acorn’s elevated cocktail program and small-batch beer and wine list. In addition to the main floor dining room, guests can relax at the 15-seat bar opposite the open kitchen or dine in the 30-seat mezzanine space which overlooks the kitchen and chef's counter and offers spectacular views of the mountains. Cement and graffiti accents and Emeco seating made from recycled Coca Cola bottles give the space an urban, eclectic feel, while the marble tabletops, ebonized wood banquettes, and well-appointed lighting provide an elegant counterpoint.</p>
