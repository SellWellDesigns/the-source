      <p>Americanum Provisions is an ingredient-driven and food-community focused grocer. It’s a celebration of urban farmers. The shop features American-made, utilitarian kitchen consignments and food products, most of which are sourced within 10 miles of The Source. This produce-forward market sells fruit and vegetables from Produce Denver, The GrowHaus, and The Squeaky Bean’s Bean Acre Farm, among many others.</p>
      
      <p>The utilitarian aesthetic of the store reminds shoppers of the humble produce retailers of the early 20th century. The Source’s urban feel combined with the freshness of Americanum’s products represents this vendor’s commitment to creating connections between urban and rural agriculture.</p>
