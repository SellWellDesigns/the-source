    <div class="well tenant-content">
      <p>Boxcar Coffee Roasters was established in 2010, with their first cafe opening shortly after in the summer of 2011on Boulder's iconic Pearl Street. Following their success in Boulder, Boxcar is now moving their roastery and have opened a new cafe in Denver here at The Source. They have developed a brewing method called the Boilermakr to help brew a great cup of coffee at Colorado's high elevation. Boxcar immerses the grounds in boiling water to get the ideal extraction out of every cup.</p>
      <p>Selecting the finest coffees available, Boxcar roasts in small batches to preserve origin character while maximizing balance & sweetness on their refurbished 1929 Gothot Ideal Rapid roaster. Their focus on hand crafted drinks and outstanding hospitality make Boxcar a great destination for all coffee lovers.</p>
