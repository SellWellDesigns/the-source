      <p>Boxcar Coffee Roasters is a Boulder-based roaster and coffee shop that opened its first location in Boulder two years ago. A Denver outpost was recently opened on the TAXI campus in DRIVE, where Boxcar shares a large lobby area with ReFuel, a casual sandwich shop. The Source will become home to Boxcar’s roaster and another outlet for its specialty brewed coffee drinks.</p>
      <p>Boxcar coffee is roasted in small batches using a vintage roaster that was built in Germany in 1929. For some of the specialty coffee drinks, baristas boil ground beans long enough to extract exact flavor, then clarify with ice cubes and strain into mugs— this cowboy coffee method of preparation improves temperature control, counteracts high elevation, and makes for a perfect cup of java.</p>
