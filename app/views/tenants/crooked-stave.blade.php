      <p>Crooked Stave Artisans is a brewery focused on Belgian sour beers with a cult-like following in Denver and beyond. Launched in 2011 in Fort Collins, the company’s wine-forward, barrel-aged beers were first brewed onsite at Funkwerks. A year later, Crooked Stave relocated to its barrel-house in Denver and brewed at nearby Prost Brewing. Finally, Crooked Stave will have a real home to brew at The Source in a 20-barrel brewhouse.</p>
      <p>In the new taproom, Crooked Stave’s followers will be able to enjoy signature beers, like the dry-hopped barrel-aged saison Vielle and the Belgian-inspired white beer St. Bretta, as well as a menu of ever-changing taps.</p>
