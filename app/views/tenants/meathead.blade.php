      <p>Meathead is the in-house butcher at The Source with a bit of comedy and traditional flair. Owner Kevin Klinger comes from a long line of butchers and learned his trade the traditional way, by doing it for over three decades. Beef hanging on hooks, not in plastic or in a box, chicken fresh from the farm and a real connection to the trade is what this meat counter is all about. Meathead aims to be a traditional and vert transparent butcher shop.</p>
      <p>Meathead sources its ethically and humanely raised and processed meats from suppliers like Four Sisters Farm and Tender Belly.</p>
